# Magic-API
Coding Exercise To Display Cards From The Magic API w/ jQuery &amp; AJAX

 The goal of this project was to consume the public "Magic" JSON API and render a responsive grid of cards. The application continues to automatically retrieve additional cards as the user scrolls down the page. Users can also search for specific cards, filter by categories or jump to specific pages.

 To view this application either download and install the wordpress plugin, download and view the HTML file, or visit:
